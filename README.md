# ProjectManagementAnalyticsTool

A Python-based analytics tool for project management that implements Critical Path Method (CPM) and Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) with advanced statistical analysis and risk assessment capabilities.

## 📊 Overview

This tool provides comprehensive project scheduling and risk analysis through mathematical modeling and statistical methods. It helps project managers identify critical tasks, estimate project duration, assess completion probabilities under uncertainty, and can solve scheduling problems across multiple industries.

## 🚀 Key Features

### Core Analytics
- **Critical Path Method (CPM)**: Identify project critical path and calculate task scheduling
- **Program Evaluation & Review Technique (PERT)**: Three-point estimation with probabilistic analysis
- **Forward/Backward Pass Calculations**: Automated scheduling computations
- **Slack Time Analysis**: Float time calculations for non-critical activities

### Advanced Analytics
- **Probability Analysis**: Z-score calculations and completion probability estimates
- **Risk Assessment**: Confidence intervals and scenario analysis (best/worst case)
- **Variance Analysis**: Project and activity-level variance calculations
- **Standard Deviation Metrics**: Uncertainty quantification at task and project levels

### Flexible Configuration
- **Multiple Time Units**: Support for hours, days, weeks, months, and years
- **Interactive Input**: Manual project definition with validation
- **Sample Projects**: Pre-built examples for quick testing
- **Dependency Management**: Complex activity dependency handling

## 📈 Technical Capabilities
